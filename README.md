# Deepfake Detector
The Deepfake Detector is a project that helps identify whether an image is real or fake. With the rise of deepfake technology, it has become harder to trust digital media. This project uses artificial intelligence to spot manipulated content and make digital spaces safer.

## What it does
* Takes an image as input
* Uses a trained deep learning model to analyze it
* Predicts if the image is real or fake
* Provides results instantly through a web app

## Why itâ€™s useful
Deepfakes are increasingly used to spread misinformation, create fake identities, or manipulate public opinion. This tool makes it easier for people to check content before trusting or sharing it. Journalists, educators, and everyday users can use it to verify authenticity.

## How it works
* The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in TensorFlow
* It has been trained on datasets of both real and manipulated images
* A **Flask web application** is included so users can upload images and get predictions quickly

## Example
Upload an image through the web app, and the system will display:
Prediction: Real  
or
Prediction: Fake  

## Future improvements
* Support for video-based deepfake detection
* Highlight manipulated regions for explainability
* Cloud deployment for large-scale use
